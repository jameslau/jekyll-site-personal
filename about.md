Welcome to my site! My name is James Lau. I’m a Boston based front-end web developer with a background in graphic design. I’ve worked with a wide range of clients and projects over the years; combined work from print, mobile, and the web.

Most recently, I’ve been concentrating my focus on front-end development with specific attention to user interface and user experiences through development.

When not working on web development you can catch me taking photos of food and checking out foodie spots around the city. I do a ton of Instagramin’ and I also curate a travel blog site called Cultural Hop. Sharing personal traveling advice and experiences for people who are curious about other cultures around the world.
