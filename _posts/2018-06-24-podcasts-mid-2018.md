We're half way through the year in 2018 and I wanted to share with you some podcasts that I've been tuning into during my morning commute to work. Normally I share only technical podcasts, but sometimes we need a break from the work mentality and explore other interesting topics that make this world go round. A breath of fresh air honestly...it doesn't hurt.

First up is [Stuff You Should Know](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/), who is hosted by Chuck Bryant and Josh Clark. A quirky duo who dabbles in all sorts of - what seems to us - day-to-day unless knowledge, is in fact quite the opposite. Jogging the brain and instilling knowledge on life's events which we take for granted every day. Such podcasts episodes as: ["What Makes Lead So Poisonous?"](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/what-makes-lead-so-poisonous.htm),["What exactly is stoicism?"](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/stoicism.htm), ["What's the deal with accents?"](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/accents.htm), ["How Tsunamis Work"](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-tsunamis-work.htm). If you're in the mood to enhance your brain and feel a bit smarter each day, go right ahead and check these guys out.

My next podcast encourages you to channel into spirituality and self-healing. Let's face it, we all have moments in the morning, during our commute home or during the evening when we're not feeling at our best. Something is bothering you and you want to escape from the drama and enter a space (in your own mind), erase the pain, and rebalance your inner soul. Take some time and check out [Tara Brach](https://www.tarabrach.com/talks-audio-video/) who is an American psychologist that teaches Buddhism (mindfulness), meditation methodologies and advisor on emotional healing. She has a mix of spirituality talks and meditation session podcasts. Here are some episodes I would recommend you listen to: [Disarming Our Hearts: Letting Go of Blame (retreat talk)](https://www.tarabrach.com/disarming-hearts-letting-go-blame/), [Meditation and Short Talk: Basic Elements of a Mindfulness Meditation Sitting (34:30 min.)](https://www.tarabrach.com/meditation-basic-elements/), [Meditation: Aliveness and Presence (20:02 min.)](https://www.tarabrach.com/meditation-aliveness-presence/), [From Head to Heart](https://www.tarabrach.com/from-head-to-heart/). Take the time to loosen your daily thoughts and learn to monitor and regulate the your senses and the mind. 

The last podcast that I would like to recommend to developers specifically is [Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea), hosted by Jonathan Cutrell. Jonathan is an experienced developer who has moved up to the ranks of a CTO in his career. With all the experiences that he's been through, he decided to start this podcast share the knowledge with the rest of us. The bulk of Developer Tea episodes revolve around managing one's own development dilemma's inside and outside of the workplace. Here's a sample of some of my favorite episodes: [Iterative Learning](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/76891), [Accepting The Unexpected](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/118939), [4 Principles of Great Learners](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/133351) and [Treating Time Seriously](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea/154354). Jonathan also interviews prominent figures in both web and non-web communities to talk about life lessons in general. 

We're all struggling out there and grinding away the typical 9-5+ hour days. But hopefully these podcasts can help enlighten your day and give you a better perspective in life.
